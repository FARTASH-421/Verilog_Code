This example shows the following Power Aware feature:

    * Mixed RTL-GLS flow

Preliminary Information
-----------------------
For information about mixed RTL-GLS flow, please visit the Power Aware User 
Manual, Chapter 3, "Power Intent Application to Mixed RTL and Gate-level Designs" 
section.


Running the example
-------------------
A do file "tkgui/run.do" has been included with this example in order to help you compile, 
optimize, and simulate the design. There is no option required to enable this flow.

This example contains an isolation strategy "mem_ctrl_iso_1", this strategy is applied 
on "/interleaver_tester/dut/mc0/web" and "/interleaver_tester/dut/mc0/ceb" ports. The 
isolation cell "ISOCELL" is inferred for the "/interleaver_tester/dut/mc0/ceb" port. 
Due to the mixed RTL-GLS flow, the tool should detect that there are isolation cells are 
inferred for the "/interleaver_tester/dut/mc0/ceb" port while the 
"/interleaver_tester/dut/mc0/web" port doesn't have isolation cells; so, the tool should 
insert isolation cell for this port.

To run the simulation, Invoke the ModelSim, then enter "do run.do" in the transcript
window. After simulation, open the report.pa.txt, the tool reports the following:

Isolation Strategy: mem_ctrl_iso_1, File: /bata/oahmed/main_ws/tests/examples/pa_sim/PA_mix_RTL_GLS/rtl_top.upf(83).
	Isolation Supplies:
		power  : /interleaver_tester/dut/VDD_0d81
		ground : /interleaver_tester/dut/VSS
	Supply Set handles:
		1. isolation_supply_set: /interleaver_tester/dut/power_0d81_ss
			Functions:
				1. power     : /interleaver_tester/dut/VDD_0d81
				2. ground    : /interleaver_tester/dut/VSS
	Isolation Control (/interleaver_tester/dut/mc_iso), Isolation Sense (HIGH), Clamp Value (1), Location (parent)
	Signals with default isolation cells:
		1. Signal : /interleaver_tester/dut/mc0/web, isolation cell : /interleaver_tester/dut/web_UPF_ISO
	Signals with -instance isolation cells:
		1. Signal : /interleaver_tester/dut/mc0/ceb[3], isolation cell : /interleaver_tester/dut/ceb_iso_3
		2. Signal : /interleaver_tester/dut/mc0/ceb[2], isolation cell : /interleaver_tester/dut/ceb_iso_2
		3. Signal : /interleaver_tester/dut/mc0/ceb[1], isolation cell : /interleaver_tester/dut/ceb_iso_1
		4. Signal : /interleaver_tester/dut/mc0/ceb[0], isolation cell : /interleaver_tester/dut/ceb_iso_0

This snapshot shows that the tool inserts an isolation cell for "/interleaver_tester/dut/mc0/web" 
port while the "/interleaver_tester/dut/mc0/ceb" port has its isolation cells.
The same behavior is applied for "mem_ctrl_ls_out" level shifter strategy.
